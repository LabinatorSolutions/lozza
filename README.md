If you are testing Lozza please use the latest release and not the coalface from the repo; which is usually broken in some way; thanks.

# Lozza

A UCI Javascript chess engine with a small 768x75x1 single srelu accumulator unquantised NNUE evaluation. Try her here:-

https://op12no2.github.io/lozza-ui

Lozza was primarily created for use in browsers, but can also be used in traditional chess UIs via ```Node.js``` and on pretty-much any platform (see below). Note however that Lozza relatively slow compared to compiled engines of a similar design, which also makes her relatively weak. 

## Basic use in a browser

All you need is ```lozza.js``` from the latest release.  

Here is a little example to do a 10 ply search:-

```Javascript
var lozza = new Worker('lozza.js');

lozza.onmessage = function (e) {
  $('#dump').append(e.data);             //assuming jquery and a div called #dump
                                         //parse messages from here as required
};

lozza.postMessage('uci');                // lozza uses the uci communication protocol
lozza.postMessage('ucinewgame');         // reset tt
lozza.postMessage('position startpos');
lozza.postMessage('go depth 10');        // 10 ply search
```

Try this example here:-

https://op12no2.github.io/lozza-ui/ex.htm

Please note that Lozza's code is folded using ```{{{``` and ```}}}``` (emacs convention) and most easily read using an editor with a folding capability.

## More examples

A sister repo has more browser-based examples for playing and analysing etc. with Lozza.

## Play Lozza offline in chess user interfaces

Lozza can be used in popular chesss user interfaces like Banksia, Winboard, Arena and CuteChess via ```Node.js```. Download the latest release and then follow the instructions in the ```readme.txt``` file.  Any platform that supports ```Node.js``` can be targetted.

## Fire up Lozza from the command line

To type UCI commands into Lozza, start ```Node.js``` with ```lozza.js``` or ```lozza``` as the parameter and then enter commands. For example:-

```
> node lozza
ucinewgame
position startpos
eval
go depth 10
quit
```
Commands can also be given on invocation, for example:-

```
> node lozza ucinewgame bench "position startpos" board "go movetime 100" quit
```

Alternatives to ```Node.js``` are ```Bun``` and ```Deno```.

## Commands specific to Lozza

```eval``` displays the current evaluation of the board.

```board``` displays the board as a FEN string.

```bench``` does a cumulative node count while searching a list of FENs, displaying the total and the time it took. It's particularly useful when checking that changes that should not affect searching have in fact not affected searching.  

```et``` tests the UE part of NNUE.

```pt``` performs a sequence of PERFT tests. 

```net``` displays network properties.

## Creating your own nets

Lozza's net was trained using ```trainer.js``` on data generated with ```datagen.js``` and ```filter.js```; a totally Javascript pipeline. Around 100M positions were used for the Lozza 3 net. Contact me if you are interested in building a different net for your project; it's very straightforward. Essentially the process is:-

```
mkdir data
node datagen             // run on as many PCs/threads as possible - see the scripts subdirectory for the script I use.
cat data/*.fen > data/x  // collate all the data into a single file.
node filter              // reads x and writes y filtering noisy moves and checks - but configurable.
shuf data/y > data/x     // shuffle the data back into x. 
node trainer             // uses x to train a net - lot's of config options like layer size, score-wdl ratio, batch size, 
                         // activation, optimiser etc. writes nets for every epoch for easy testing (see data sub-dir).
                         // The nets can be pasted into lozza.js replacing the existing one. No other changes are needed.
```

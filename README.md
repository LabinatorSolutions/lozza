# Lozza

A Javascript chess engine inspired by Fabien Letouzey's Fruit 2.1. Lozza was an exercise in principal variation search and hand-coded evaluation. 

## Basic use

All you need is lozza.js from the root of the repository.

```Javascript
var lozza = new Worker('lozza.js');

lozza.onmessage = function (e) {
  $('#dump').append(e.data);             //assuming jquery and a div called #dump
                                         //parse messages from here as required
};

lozza.postMessage('uci');                // get build etc
lozza.postMessage('ucinewgame');         // reset TT
lozza.postMessage('position startpos');
lozza.postMessage('go depth 10');        // 10 ply search
```

## Play Lozza offline in chess user interfaces

While primarily intended for use in a browser context, Lozza can be used offline on almost any platform via Nodejs and chess user interfaces like Winboard, Arena, Cutechess and Banksia. Download the latest Lozza release and follow the instructions in readme.txt.

## Notes

lozza.js is folded using {{{ and }}} (emacs convention) and most easily read using an editor with a folding capability.

lozza.js in the repo root has debug code marked with ##ifdef, which can be removed on release of your project with:-

```
Windows: findstr -V ##ifdef lozza.js
Linux:   grep -v \#\#ifdef lozza.js
```

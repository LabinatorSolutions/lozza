# Lozza

A Javascript chess engine inspired by Fabien Letouzey's Fruit 2.1. 

It's easy to use Lozza in your web projects by firing it up a web worker and then communicating using the UCI protocol.

Lozza code is folded using {{{ and }}} (emacs convention) and most easily read using an editor with a folding capability.

## Basic use

All you need is lozza.js from the root of the repo. 

Note that lozza.js has tuning and debug code marked with ##ifdef, which will _signigicantly affect performance_. It is potentially useful during development, but can be removed like this:-

```
Windows: findstr -V ##ifdef lozza.js > mylozza.js
Linux:   grep -v \#\#ifdef lozza.js > mylozza.js
```
You should also change the TTSIZE constant from a power of 22 to 24 if using long time controls; i.e. minutes not seconds per game.

Here is a little example to do a 10 ply search:-

```Javascript
var lozza = new Worker('lozza.js');

lozza.onmessage = function (e) {
  $('#dump').append(e.data);             //assuming jquery and a div called #dump
                                         //parse messages from here as required
};

lozza.postMessage('uci');                // get build etc
lozza.postMessage('ucinewgame');         // reset TT
lozza.postMessage('position startpos');
lozza.postMessage('go depth 10');        // 10 ply search
```

# Lozza

A Javascript chess engine inspired by Fabien Letouzey's Fruit 2.1. 

It's easy to use Lozza in your web projects by firing it up a web worker and then communicating using the UCI protocol.

Lozza code is folded using ```{{{``` and ```}}}``` (emacs convention) and most easily read using an editor with a folding capability.

## Play Lozza offline in chess user interfaces

As a UCI engine Lozza can be used in popular chesss user interfaces like Banksia, Winboard, Arena and CuteChess. Download the latest release and then follow the instructions in the ```readme.txt``` file.  Any platform that supports ```Node.js``` can be targetted.

## Basic use in web pages

All you need is ```lozza.js``` from the latest release. The one in the root is usually broken in some way. 

Here is a little example to do a 10 ply search:-

```Javascript
var lozza = new Worker('lozza.js');

lozza.onmessage = function (e) {
  $('#dump').append(e.data);             //assuming jquery and a div called #dump
                                         //parse messages from here as required
};

lozza.postMessage('uci');                // get build etc
lozza.postMessage('ucinewgame');         // reset TT
lozza.postMessage('position startpos');
lozza.postMessage('go depth 10');        // 10 ply search
```

## More examples

A sister repo has more examples for playing and analysing etc. with Lozza.

## Testing and tuning

There are various scripts in the testing directory that can be run with ```Node.js```. For example:-

```
cd testing
node tuner
```

Training data used is Alexandru Moșoi's (Zurichess) ```quiet-labeled.epd```. 

There is a web-based PERFT script that can be run here:-

https://op12no2.github.io/lozza-ui/perft.htm

I use Windows, but any platform with a ```Node.js``` executable is suitable for testing and tuning.

In a ```Node.js``` or web script you can call Lozza's functional interface directly (e.g. see ```tuner.js```) or call Lozza's UCI interface like this (e.g. see ```perft.js```):-

```
var depth = 10;
onmessage({data: 'ucinewgame\nposition startpos'});  // separate multiple UCI commands with \n
onmessage({data: 'go depth ' + depth});
```

Lozza has a little utility function called ```docmd``` to make this a little easier:-

```
var depth = 10;
docmd('ucinewgame\nposition startpos');  // separate multiple UCI commands with \n
docmd('go depth ' + depth);
```

After a search, the best move is in ```lozza.stats.bestMove``` in binary form (see constants). You can format it like this:-

```
console.log(lozza.board.formatMove(lozza.stats.bestMove, UCI_FMT);  // e.g. g1f3
console.log(lozza.board.formatMove(lozza.stats.bestMove, SAN_FMT);  // e.g. Nf3
```

To type UCI commands into Lozza directly, just fire it up with ```Node.js```:-

```
> cd _location of lozza.js_
> node lozza
```

Lozza has some UCI command extensions and shortcuts detailed here:-

https://op12no2.github.io/lozza-ui/consolehelp.htm

That may well be out of date. Check the ```switch``` statement in the ```onmessage``` function for the coalface.

You can supply UCI commands on invocation like this for example:-

```
> cd _location of lozza.js_
> node lozza ucinewgame "position startpos" "go depth 10"
```
There is also a web-based UCI console here:-

https://op12no2.github.io/lozza-ui/console.htm

The ```bench``` command allows a quick check after tweaks that should not affect search. It's a node count across various FENs at depth 9 and takes a few seconds to run:-

```
> cd _location of lozza.js_
> node lozza bench quit
nodes 4625388 8993
_tweak something_
> node lozza bench quit
nodes 4625388 9121
```

The node counts should match, like they do above. The times will vary from run to run even without any changes to the code.
